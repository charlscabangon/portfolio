### CHARLS CABANGON

---

My personal portfolio. Built with React, styled with _love_ (and Tailwind).

Clean code. Maintainable architecture. One source of truth. No spaghetti, no shortcuts, just solid frontend work from someone who actually cares about the next person reading it (probably future me).

UI inspired by Tailwind. Responsive, fast, and animated just enough to feel premium without being annoying.
